# portfolio

A single page portfolio designed to showcase my work as junior web developer in training.

This fully responsive site was designed on Figma and was put together using HTML, SCSS, Flexbox, B.E.M., Bootstrap, and mobile first design principles. It is currently a work in progress.

The clouds were made using a combination of SVG filters and box shadows, inspired by Beau Jackson's brilliant article on 'Drawing Realistic Clouds with SVG and CSS' (available here https://css-tricks.com/drawing-realistic-clouds-with-svg-and-css/) and his 'Nephele' cloud generator (available here https://www.nephele.cloud).
